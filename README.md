BEZUBAAN - BE KIND TO EVERY KIND

"BE KIND TO ALL KINDS" - There are medical services available for humans everywhere and in any circumstance, but when it comes to animals, no one is there to supply them with the essential medical attention.
 A report reveals that over one thousand stray animals (dogs, cats, monkeys, and cows, etc.) are killed by accidents every four months in India. 
Some of them are because they do not get prompt help or their remains are abandoned on Indian streets after death.

WHAT IF THEY MAY ALSO RECEIVE EMERGENCY MEDICAL ASSISTANCE? 
Now assume an accident occurs and the driver does not stop and flees. 
No one likes to aid the wounded animal since it is a laborious task, but what if they just had to tap a button and instant assistance would be supplied to the animal?
My team is proposing an app that provides EMERGENCY SERVICE   to both stray and domesticated animals. 
When an accident involving a stray animal occurs OR  people notice an injured Animal. 
They can simply tap a button on our app, which will share the location of the area where the animal is, and our rescue team will immediately arrive. 
We are aware that there are a number of organizations that provide this service, but what sets us apart is that we will provide immediate rescue by stationing our teams and veterinary doctors at various stops throughout a city. In urban areas, traffic cameras are mounted on roadways to identify the violation of traffic signals. 
What does it do?
It employs image processing and image skimming identical to how our team will create a MODEL to identify stray animals and incidents involving them so that we can rescue them.

Our application will also collaborate with the forest department and animal welfare department of the government to rescue wild animals.
 As sometimes wild animals enter cities, it would be difficult to call a helpline and share the exact location.
 However, if they use our app, they can send the location and the type of animal (as we will provide an option between the number of animals that could be present, as every forest has its native wild species, this option will allow the forest department to send a team fully equipped to rescue a specific animal) to the local forest department, and a team will be dispatched to rescue the animal.
 Thus, our app focuses mostly on animal welfare. as stated in our slogan, BE KIND TO ALL KINDS.

Alternatively, our software may generate revenue by offering veterinarian services for pets. 
Veterinary services are not readily accessible in the majority of locales. 
There are also pet owners who cannot take their animals to the veterinarian for various reasons. 
Simply reserve a time window, and our doctor will visit your home and provide the necessary therapy.

Taking a pet for regular grooming sessions is a cumbersome process, but what if a groomer came to your home? Our app will include a function that allows you to schedule grooming appointments for your pet, and a groomer will come to your home to groom your pet.

 On our app, one will be able to purchase affordable animal accessories and medication. As animal medication is difficult to get in medical stores.
